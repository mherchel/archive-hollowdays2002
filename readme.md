# Hollow Days Website Circa 2003

This is the first version of a website that I did for my brother's band back in 2003. Check out my awesome Fireworks, Dreamweaver and classic ASP skillz (yes... Skillz with a 'z'!).

My brother's band is still around. Feel free to download the MP3s and check them out at [https://www.facebook.com/hollowdaysrocks](https://www.facebook.com/hollowdaysrocks)!

You can see this site on Github pages at [http://hd2003.herchel.com/](http://hd2003.herchel.com/).
