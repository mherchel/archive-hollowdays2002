# Hollow Days Website Circa 2002

This is the first version of a website that I did for my brother's band back in 2002. My brother's band is still around. Feel free to download the MP3s and check them out at [https://www.facebook.com/hollowdaysrocks](https://www.facebook.com/hollowdaysrocks).

You can see this site on Github pages at [https://hollow-days-2002.netlify.app/](https://hollow-days-2002.netlify.app/).
