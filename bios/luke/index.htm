          The child would be born with the abilitly to keep time and rythem in 
          an <i>uncanny</i> way. Before the child was even born, his mother patted 
          her belly to the rythem and beat to the great music of the time, <b>David

        <td colspan="3" valign="top"> set into place the formation of a <i>rawk</i> 
          god begain. Lessons started and a man by the name of Jaret started molding 
          and forming pure raw energy into the well oiled refined playing machine 
          that he is today. Starting with the basic rudementry beats and pentameter 
          of <b>Pearl Jam</b> and <b>Alice in Chains</b>, and finnaly graduating 
          to the metal crunch of <b>Metallica</b>. From then on the boy was being 
          formed into what he is today. For about 2 yrs. the boy lost all intrest 
          in his gifts. He spent his time honing the dark majiks of sothern folklore. 
          It was a move that once again jump started the prodigy into drums. From 
          there he started playing <i>from morning to night,</i> a couple of time 
          the <b>law</b> was called to make him stop. Little did they know that 
          it just motivated him to play <b>harder</b> , <b>louder</b> and <i><b>faster</b></i>. 
          After locking himself into his room for 3 yrs he felt it was time to 
          suprise the world with his playing ablities. According to urbin legend 
          he roams around playing genra to genra, bestowing his gifts and talents 
          to all who wish to a part of them. He gives freely to those in need. 
          Administers justice to those who lack justice. He brings light to dark 
          and night to day. the hunter of the shadow is rising. He is here to 
          stay to bring the love of music to all who wish to hear.<br>
          He is I and <i>I am him</i>, together we join to form me. </td>
