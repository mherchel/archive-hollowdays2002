        <p align="left"> &quot;I think it's an artist's function to <i><b>reflect</b></i> 
          his times.&quot; says Joe Herchel, guitarist for Gainesville rockers 
          Hollow Days.&quot;The Doors had an album out in the late 60's called 
          <b>'Strange Days'</b> and I'm sure those were <i>strange</i> days to 
          say the least. Then I thought about the music of our <i>generation</i>, 
          with <a href="http://www.britneyspears.com" target="_blank">Britney</a>, 
          <a href="http://www.drivenbyboredom.com/bling.htm" target="_blank">bling-bling</a><b> 
          </b>and <a href="http://www.nsync.com" target="_blank">boy bands</a>. 
          There's no <i>soul</i> there. It's <b><i>hollow</i></b>. It's all about<b> 
          big titty bitches and dance steps</b>. That's what we're <i>against</i>. 
          We wanna bring back the <i>emotion</i> and <i>meaning</i> that seems 
          to be missing in a lot of today's music. So that's why we called the 
          band<b> Hollow Days</b>. It's a statement about our <i>culture</i>.&quot; 
        </p>
        <p> <b> Hollow Days</b> is a hard rock band out of <b>Gainesville</b> 
          whose powerful, <i>high energy</i> songs are making a strong <i>impression</i> 
          on the Florida<b> music scene</b>. Instead of trying to follow the trends 
          of the moment, the guys in<b> Hollow Day</b>s do what they know <i>best</i>: 
          straight up <i><b>solid hard rock</b></i>. Inspired and influenced by 
          bands like The Doors, Black Sabbath, Stone Temple Pilots and Guns n' 
          Roses, <a href="nick/">Nick Estes (lead vocals)</a>,<a href="joe/"> 
          Joe Herchel (guitar)</a>,<a href="jeremy/"> Jeremy Luallen(bass, vocals, 
          keyboard)</a>, and<a href="luke/"> Luke Pidgeon(drums)</a>, craft songs 
          that are at once <b>original</b> yet somehow <i>familiar</i>. Strong 
          hooks, <i>soaring</i> choruses and <i><b>killer groves</b></i> conduct 
          the power and <i>emotion</i> of these songs to the listener.<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;In the short time the <b>band</b> has been together, they have 
          built a <i>strong</i> following primarily due to the <b>strength</b> 
          of their<i><b> live show</b></i>. Nick Estes a <i>frontman</i> in every 
          sense of the word, <b>commanding</b> the stage and crowd with his high 
          level of <i>passion</i> and <i>energy</i>. He has a <b>great vocal range 
          </b>and <i>incredible presence</i>. The man was <i>born</i> to perform! 
          Speaking of performing, guitarist Joe Herchel is a<b> wild man </b>on 
          stage, often appearing <i>possessed</i> by the music as he <i>effortlessly</i> 
          peels off <b>blistering leads </b>and <b>bone crunching</b> riffs. &quot;Guitar 
          Joe&quot;, as he is called by fans, eats, sleeps and breathes <i>music</i>. 
          Because of his many talents, Jeremy Luallen could be considered the 
          <i>glue</i> of the group, holding the songs together with<i> atmospheric 
          </i>keyboards and creative bass playing. His voice blends with Nick's 
          <i>perfectly</i>, adding a level of <b>depth</b> and <i>texture</i> 
          most bands just don't have. If Jeremy is the glue, then Luke is definitely 
          the <b>backbone</b>. His thunderous drum beats provide a <b>rock solid 
          foundation </b>for the band. Blessed with an intuitive sense of <i>dynamics</i> 
          and structure, his <i>powerful</i> drumming makes each song stand out. 
          The <i>chemistry</i> these four have together is nothing short of amazing.<br>
          <br>
          Recently the band entered <a href="http://www.recroomrecording.com/" target="_blank">Rec 
          Room Recording Studios</a> and cut three of their most popular tunes. 
          The resulting CD is an effective demonstration of the traits that helped 
          make the band so popular. Since its release, stations such as <a href="http://www.rock104.com/" target="_blank">Rock 
          104 103.7 FM</a>, <a href="http://www.wjrr.com/" target="_blank">Real 
          Rock 101.1</a> and <a href="http://www.1005thebuzz.com/" target="_blank">The 
          Buzz 100.5 FM</a> have given the band airtime.<b> Hollow Days</b> has 
          played in <i>numerous</i> cities throughout Florida, and are currently 
          looking to expand their fan base the <i>old fashioned</i> way: getting 
          up on stage and putting on a <i><b>kick-ass rock show,</b></i> winning 
          the crowds over one person at a time. Though maintaining a website (www.hollowdays.com), 
          handling out and posting fliers, sending out updates to their <a href="/list/" target="_parent">mailing 
          list</a>, contacting club owners, radio stations, other bands and various 
          media outlets can be grueling, these guys actually <i>enjoy</i> these 
          activities because they know that it will lead to yet another opportunity 
          to step on stage, <i>feel</i> the lights, hear the <b>crowd</b>, and 
          <b>kick out the jams</b>. </p>
