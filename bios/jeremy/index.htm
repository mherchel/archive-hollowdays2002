        Hollow Days?&#8230; That&#8217;s the way Jeremy sees it. Jeremy, bass 
        player and keyboardist for Hollow Days, knows that some day Hollow Days&#8217; 
        music will be as influential and timeless as some of greatest bands of 
        all time. Before Hollow Days, Jeremy was in two bands and jamming with 
        friends had become a routine occurrence. His drive to play music was far 
        beyond that of any reasonable person and eventually it led him to seek 
        out lifelong friend Nick Estes for every opportunity to make some music. 
        E stes introduced Jeremy to Joe Herchel, and the seeds for a brilliant 
        band were planted. <br> <br>
        Though Jeremy cites his musical influences from a variety of sources in 
        a variety of genres, his main love has always been classic rock. &#8220;Any 
        music that makes you feel something, whether it be happy, depressed, invincible, 
        out of touch, whatever, is doing its job.&#8221; Music is just a reflection 
        of its listener, and for Jeremy it is a reflection of himself. He hopes 
        that someday his music and the music of Hollow Days will have an impact 
        on anyone and everyone. </td>
